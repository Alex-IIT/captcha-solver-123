# Simple Captcha Solver (Client-Side Mock)This project provides a single-file, responsive HTML application that simulates a client-side captcha solver. It's built with HTML, Tailwind CSS for styling, and vanilla JavaScript for interactivity.## Features- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to various screen sizes using Tailwind CSS.- **Dynamic Image Loading:** Can display a captcha image from a URL provided as a query parameter (e.g., `index.html?url=https://example.com/captcha.png`).- **Default Image:** Defaults to `sample.png` if no URL parameter is provided.- **Client-Side Validation:** Includes a basic JavaScript logic to "solve" a hardcoded captcha, demonstrating the concept.## How to Use1.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.2.  **Provide a Captcha Image (Optional):** To display an external captcha image, append a `?url=` query parameter to the URL in your browser's address bar.    Example: `file:///path/to/your/index.html?url=https://example.com/path/to/your/captcha.png`    (Note: Due to CORS policies, directly loading images from arbitrary external URLs into `canvas` or manipulating them via script might be restricted for a *real* solver, but for display in `<img>` it's usually fine.)3.  **Solve the Captcha:**    *   If using the `sample.png`, the correct answer is `ADCRB`.    *   Enter your solution into the input field and click "Submit".## Important Note on "Solver" FunctionalityThis application provides a **mock client-side solver**. A true captcha solver typically involves:1.  **Image Processing:** Analyzing the image to extract characters (e.g., using Optical Character Recognition - OCR).2.  **Server-Side Logic:** Most robust captcha validation happens on the server to prevent client-side bypasses.The JavaScript logic here is purely for demonstration purposes, checking against a hardcoded string (`"ADCRB"`). It does not perform actual image recognition.## Technologies Used-   HTML5-   Tailwind CSS (via CDN)-   Vanilla JavaScript## LicenseThis project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
